# what did I do (mac)...
- installed python 3.13: `brew install python@3.13`
- create project dir
- cd to project dir
- created a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv name_of_venv`
    - worth noting that I had a dir with sub-dirs. One of them, app-1, contained the project file. the venv was in the parent dir
- activate the venv: `source name_of_venv/bin/activate`
- install requirements.txt: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- create main.py
- cut and paste example code: `https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/gettingstarted.html#create-your-first-qt-application-with-qt-widgets`
- test with: `python main.py`
- if application runs, it's ready to test compilation with pyside6-deploy
- I don't know if it's needed, but I ran this first: `pyside6-deploy --dry-run app-1/main.py --mode=standalone`
    - note, I was in the parent dir, where the venv was located
- then I ran: `pyside6-deploy app-1/main.py --mode=standalone`
- then I opened the folder in explorer and attempted to open the app, auto generated with the title "pyside_app_demo.app," via double click
